Frames:  
========
	- Frames are the html documents embedded inside another html document
	- i.e., a webpage inside another webpage
	- Frames are often used to divide a window into multiple sections so that we can stop 
interactions with webelements


Identifying Frames:
====================
==> right click in webpage --> if there is an option called View Frame Source , then the webpage
				has been created with frames.
		(or)
==> search in DOM page for keywords like frame, iframe , frameset then it has frames

Handling Frames:
================
 - switch control to the frame we want to interact

==> driver.switchTo().frame(index);
==> driver.switchTo().frame(name or id);
==> driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement);

==> driver.switchTo().defaultContent(); -----> to switch back to page
