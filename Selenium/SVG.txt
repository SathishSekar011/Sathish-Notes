SVG :
======
	- Scalable Vector Graphics is used to create vector-type diagrams like bar charts, pie charts, scalable icons, scalable logos, and other design diagrams. 
	- SVG elements can not be captured by the selenium IDE using any locators.
	- we have to use xpath with some modification to locate svg elements

	==> //*[local-name()='svg' and @attribute='value']

for child inside svg
==> /*[local-name()='svg' and @attribute='value']//*[name()='tagname' and @att='value']
	
	- we can't able to use axes(xpath relations) while locating svg elements.

The challenges faced by the automation engineer in capturing these SVG elements are,
	- Time-consuming
	- Might not be accurate 
	- Might not be stable
