Waits:
======
--> Synchronization:    If the speed of the browser and speed of the selenium matches 
			then they are called as Synchronized

How to Achieve Synchronization:-   Waits

Two types of Waits:
-------------------
(i)Static Wait:
===============
	--> Thread.sleep(millis);
	- For the mentioned time the Selenium will wait whether the webpage is loaded or not and Only when the wait time is over then it will proceed to the next step

(ii) Dynamic Wait:
==================
	- Once the Webpage is loaded within the mentioned time, it will not wait for the remaining time

Dynamic Wait:
--------------
Three types:

1) Implicit Wait:
=================
	- It will resolve the Synchronization issue of findElement and findElements method 
	- It will check whether the element is present or not only
	- It wont check the element is interactable, displayed or clickable
	- Once implicit wait is initialized then all the findElement, findElements correspending to object driver will come under implicit wait except driver.quit();
	- implicit wait has a default polling period of 500ms, For every 500ms it will check 
	  the element is present or not

	--> Syntax: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(12, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
		    driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(12));

Cons:-- 
	- It'll check weather the element is present in DOM or not. It won't check weather it is visible or interactable. so that there is posiblities of throwing exception.
	- We can't able to define conditions for waiting period

2) Explicit Wait:
================
	- Apart from locating the elements it will also check if the element is intractable or not 
	- For every instance Explicit wait has to be declared
		-- elementToBeClickable()
		-- elementToBeSelected()
		-- Element is present or not
		-- Element contains text or not
		-- Alert is present
		-- WebPage is loaded completely
		-- Button is clickable
		-- frames is present
	- It is achieved by WebDriverWait
	- This WebDriverWait will always require ExpectedConditions

Syntax:
=======
	==> WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(WebDriver,Duration);
	==> wait.until(ExpectedConditions.condition(WebElement));



3)Fluent Waits:
===============
	- Used to set the frequency or polling period 
	- If Exceptions occurs within the polling period it can also be handled by fluent wait
