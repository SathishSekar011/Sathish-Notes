Variables:
==========
* Variables are containers for store the data.
* Javascript variables can be declared in 4 ways:
1. Automatically
2. Using var
3. Using let
4. Using const

Rules to declare the variables:
==============================
1) No javascript keywords used -> var var=10;-> cannot declare like that
2) should not start with number
3) No space and No -
4) Its case sensitive
var ab=10;
console.log(Ab); -> won't accept
5) use Meaningful name

Initialization, reassignment and redeclaration, scope
=====================================================
Initialization
==============
var a=0;//initialization
console.log(a); //op - 0
var b;//only declration not initialized
console.log(b);//op-undefined

var can be declared with initialization
var can be declared without initialization
it wont throw any error.

let a=0;//initialization

console.log(a); //op - 0
let a;//only declaration not initialized
console.log(a);//op-undefined

let can be declared with initialization
let can be declared without initialization
it wont throw any error.

const a=0;;/declared with initialization
const a;//declared without initialization -> throw error
because, const must be declared with initialization

Reassginment
============
var a=10;
console.log(a);//op- 10
a=20;
console.log(a);//op - 20

var declared variable values can be reassigned
variable value will be updated

let a=10;
console.log(a);//op-10
a=20;
console.log(a);//op-20

let declared variable values can be reassigned
variable value will be updated

const a=10;
a=20;
console.log(a);
//op - TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

const values cannot be reassigned, cannot be changes
const -> final variable -> final value

Redeclaration
=============
var a=20;
console.log(a);//op-20
var a=30;//redeclaration
console.log(a);//op-30

var variables can be redeclared
var variables can be duplicated

let a=20;
console.log(a);
let a=30;
console.log(a);//error -> cannot redeclare the block scope variable

let variables cannot be redeclared

const a=20;
console.log(a);
const a=30;
console.log(a);//error -> cannot redeclare the block scope variable

const variables cannot be redeclared

Scope
=====
Global
block - { 
}

{
let a=30;
console.log(a);//op - 30
}
console.log(a);//Reference a is not defined

let -> scope -> block level only -> declared in the block

let a=20;
{
console.log(a);//op-20
}
console.log(a);//op-20

let declared outside block-> global level -> can be called inside the block
also

{
var a=30;
console.log(a);//op - 30
}
console.log(a);//op -30

var-> scope -> global level-> var values can be declared inside the block
can be called outside the block also -> No reference error will come

var a=20;
{
console.log(a);//op-20
}
console.log(a);//op-20

{
const a=30;
console.log(a);//op - 30
}
console.log(a);//ReferenceError: a is not defined

const-> scope -> block level only -> declared in the block

const a=20;
{
console.log(a);//op-20
}
console.log(a);//op-20

const declared outside block-> global level -> can be called inside the
block also

var - with initialization, without initialization can be declared
can be reassigned
can be redeclared
global level scope

let - with initialization, without initialization can be declared
can be reassigned
cannot be redeclared
block level scope

const- declared only with initialization, cannot declared without initialization
cannot be reassigned
cannot be redeclared
block level scope
