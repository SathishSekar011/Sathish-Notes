CUCUMBER FRAMEWORK:
===================
	==> BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) with the execution of TDD (Test Driven Development)
	==> Used to convert the exact requirements into plain English language.
	==> support insprint automation.
	==> Non-Technical people can also understand the automation coverage.
	==> Cucumber supports Ruby,Java,Grovy,Python,.NET and PHP.
	==> We can use the Gherkin language or Gherkin Keyword (Plain English).
	==> Cucumber options.
	==> Cucumber Reports.

BDD FRAMEWORK:
==============
1. Cucumber
2. Jbehave
3. Nbehave
4. Specflow

CUCUMBER ANNOTATIONS
=====================
==> @Given
==> @When
==> @Then
==> @CucumberOption
==> @Runwith(Cucumber.class)

GHERKIN Keyword / GHERKIN Language:
====================================
==> Feature		
==> Scenario
==> Given
==> When
==> Then
==> And
==> But
==> Scenario Outline
==> Examples
==> Background


Feature:
--------
	--> Feature defines the logical test funtionality test [What you will test the feature file].
	--> Feature keyword is present at the starting of the feature file.

Scenario:
---------
	--> Business rule[Provides the scenario name /purpose of the scenario].

Given:
-------
	--> Some precondition step.

When:
------
	--> Some key actions.

Then:
-----
	--> To observe the outcomes or validation.

Scenario Outline:
------------------
	--> Used to execute the same scenario with multiple times wih different set of test datas.

Examples:
----------
	--> Used to pass the parameters using the | (pipe symbol) | separate the each variables.

But:
----- 
	--> Used to add negative type comments.

Background:
-----------
	--> Define steps which is are common to all the tests in the feature file.
And:
-----
	--> Used to add conditions in feature file.


CUCUMBER OPTIONS:
==================
==> features	--> set: The paths of the feature files 		     --> {}
==> glue	--> set: The paths of the step definition files		     --> {}
==> dryRun	--> true: Checks if all the steps have the Step Definition   --> false
==> monochrome	--> true: Display the console output in much readable format --> false
==> plugin	--> set: What all the report formats to use		     --> {}
		--> pretty
==> tags
==> strict	--> true: Will fail execution, if there are undefined or pending steps --> false


Dependencies:
==============
==> cucumber - junit
==> cucumber - java

Plugin:
=======
==> Download cucumber plugin from Eclipse Market Place


Step 1:
========
	--> Create a maven project

Step 2:Feature File
====================
	--> Plain English commands
	--> Crete a Folder --> create a feature file(name.feature)

Step 3: TestRunner Class
=========================
	--> it connects feature files and StepDefinitions

Step 4: StepDefinitions
=========================
	--> Step by step of codings with respective to Feature file









Data Tables:
============
	- is used to get values from feature file
--> 1D Datatable without Heading	--> asList();	--> List
--> 1D Datatable with Heading		--> asMap();	--> Map
--> 2D Datatable without Heading	--> asLists();  --> List<List>
--> 2D Datable with Heading		--> asMaps();	--> List<Map>





plugin :
pretty
html ==> "html:location\\filename.html"
json ==> "json:location\\filename.json"
xml  ==> "junit:location\\filename.xml"


Background:
===========
	- used to define a step or series of steps that are common to all the tests in the feature file. 	- It allows you to add some context to the scenarios for a feature where it is defined. 
	- A Background is much like a scenario containing a number of steps but it runs before each and every scenario were for a feature in which it is defined. 






HooksClass:
==============
--> @Before
--> @After
--> @BeforeStep
--> @AfterStep

**==> If we are creating HooksClass inside StepDefinition Class no need to add it to glue option, or else we have to add the package that contains Hooks class in glue option

**==> The background is run before each of your scenarios but after any of your @Before hook.
**==> Any feature level dependency should be tie with the background and any scenario level dependency should be tie with hooks.
**==>Use Background when you provide customer-readable pre-conditions to your scenarios
**==>Use Before when you have to do some technical setup before your scenarios

Tags:
=======
Scenario ==> @tagname1
	 ==> @tagname2
CuccumberOptions ==> tags = "@tagname1 and @tagname2"
		 ==> tags = "@tagname1 or @tagname2"

Tagged Hooks:
=============
@Before(@tagname1)  --> will execute only before that particualr tag
