Javascript: mocha, livescript
===========
* Javascript (JS) is a cross-platform,object-oriented programming language used by developers to make web pages interactive.
* It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations,pop-up menus, clickable buttons, control multimedia, etc.

With javascript, we can build:
==============================
1. Websites- amazon,facebook ect..
2. Web app- remote server
3. Mobile apps- installed by  	Google Play Store
4. Games-puzzle solving
5. Ai and machine learning(TensorFlow -NLP)

Why we should learn javascript:
==============================
1. Great career opportunity
2. Easy to learn
3. Wide range of usages
4. Easy to solve the issues

* Cypress only support - javascript
* Palywright - javascript, python, c# and java
* Selenium - javascript, java, python, ruby, c#

Javascript frameworks:

Why we go for node:
===================
* Previously - Browser having the javascript engine, using javascript engine the javascript will run only for browsers(javascript engine inbuild for the browser).
* Now we have the node, using node without javascript engine, we can run the browser.
Using node, we can create
1. Web applications
2. Mobile applications
3. Backend applications

Softwares need to download:
===========================
1. Vs code - after download vs code and add plugin of live server.
2. Node js

Node.js:
=======
Node.js is an open source, cross platform, back end javascript runtime environment that runs on the v8 engine
 and executes javascript code outside a web browser.

Download Node.js:
=================
1. Download node.js based on bits(32, 64).msi file
2. Install ths node.js
3. Set path to system environmental variables
4. Under system variables we have a path select and click on edit
5. Click new button and paste the path of node file
6. Where i get the path
   go to C-drive -> program files -> nodejs -> copy the path( c:\program file\nodejs)
7. Paste the path to system variables path and click on ok
8. Open command prompt type node -v its shows version of node.

VS code:
========
1. Search vs code download in local machine
2. Open first link and download vs code zip file
