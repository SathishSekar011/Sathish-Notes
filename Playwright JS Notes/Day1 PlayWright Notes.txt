Why Playwright?
================

1 Reliable End-to-End Testing
-----------------------------
Playwright's Auto-wait capability ensures reliable and stable end-to-end testing for modern web applications, even in the face of dynamic and complex user interactions. I
	eg:
		if like to click any element 
		locator.click() -> first it will check 
				1. Element should be visible 
				2. Element should be stable 
				3. Element should be enable 
			If these conditions aren’t met within the default timeout (usually 30 seconds), it throws a TimeoutError.

what is Node.js
===============
 * node.js is an open source, cross platform, back end javascript runtime environment that runs on the v8 engine and executes javascript code outside the browser.

    Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.

  npx playwright test example
    Runs the tests in a specific file.

  npx playwright test --debug
    Runs the tests in debug mode.

  npx playwright codegen
    Auto generate tests with Codegen.

We suggest that you begin by typing:
