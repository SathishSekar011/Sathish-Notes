SDLC --> Waterfall Methodology , Spiral Methodology , V-shape Methodology , Agile 

Waterfall Model:
=================
	--> Docomentation Process
	--> For long projects
1)Requirement Analysis - SRS
2)System Design
3)Implementation
4)Testing
5)Deployment
6)Maintenance

	--> Every phase will be input for the next phase
	--> Until one phase completed we can't go for next phase

Advantages:
------------
	- Quality will be good(Every phase will have detailed documentation)
	- Requirements changes are not allowed so there is less chance in finding bugs
	- Initial Investment is less
	- When Requirements are freezed Waterfall is Preferd

Disadvantages of WaterFall:
-----------------------------
	- Requirements changes are not allowed
	- if there is a defect in one phase it'll be continued in upcomming phases

===================================================
Spiral Model:
=============
	- for each and every cycle a new version will be released to customer.
	- for every cycle there will be requirement analysis , design , implementation , evaluation.
	- iterative model
	- it is also called version control model

Advantages:
-----------
	- testing is done in every cycle
	- customer can use software of every version
	- requirement changes are allowed after completion of every cycle

Disadvantage:
-------------
	- requirement changes are not allowed in between cycle	 

===================================================

V Model:
========
Two Parts:
-----------
	--> Verification
	--> Validation

	- for every phase there will be testing


Advantages:
-----------
	--> testing involved in each and every phase

Diadvantage:
------------
	--> Documentation is more
