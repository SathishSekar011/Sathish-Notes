Level of Testing:
=================
		- to ensure the Quality of the Application
		- to find the missing Areas and to avoid Overlapping and repetation of SDLC

1) Unit testing:
=================
	- Should be done by Developers
	- Analyzing each module/unit component
	- White Box Techniques


2) Integration testing:
========================
	- Should done by Testers(at UI level) or some times by developers(at code level)
	- Integration--Combining or merging two Modules
	- to test the dataflow while integrating modules
	- going to test modules Software in a Group
	- to find out the accuracy of communication Between modules  
	- testers do test to validate the stability of app
	- Based on Black Box Techniques


		top down approach  - higher modules to lower modules(Parent to Child)
		bottom up approach - lower modules to higher Modules
		big bang approach  - integrated modules


3) System testing:
==================
	- Done by Testers
	- To check Complete functinality of the Appplications with respective to client requirements
	- based on Black Box Testing Technique

Types of System Testing:
-------------------------
	--> GUI Testing
	--> Functional Testing --- Smoke Testing, Sanity Testing, Regression Testing
	--> Non-functional Testing -- Security testing , Performance testing , Stress Testing
	--> Usability Testing


4) UAT - user acceptance testing:
==================================
	- done by client side with the help of testers
	- Alpha testing - inhouse developers/testers
	- Beta testing - loyal customers/ limited customers.
