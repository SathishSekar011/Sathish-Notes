Test plan template contents:
-----------------------------
	--> Overview
	--> Scope
		- Inclusions
		- Test Environments
		- Exclusions
	--> Test Strategy
	--> Defect Reporting Procedure
	--> Roles/Responsibilities

==> Requrement Traceablity Matrix(RTM):
========================================
	--> RTM describes the mapping of Requirement's with the Test cases.
	--> The main purpose of RTM is to see that all test cases are covered so that no functionality should miss while doing Software testing.

Requirement Traceability Matrix-Parameters:
-------------------------------------------
	- Requirement ID
	- Req Description
	- Test case ID's


==> Test Environment:
======================
	--> we have to replicate the customers environment before getting build from Developer
	--> Test Environment is a platform specially build for test case execution on the software product.
	--> It is created by integrating the required software and hardware along with proper network configurations.	
	--> Test environment simulates production/real time environment.
	--> also called as Test Bed.
