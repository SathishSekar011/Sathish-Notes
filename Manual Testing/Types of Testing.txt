Type of testing:
=================

1) Black Box testing:
----------------------
	- done by testers
	- without knowing the internal coding knowledge of the application
	- User Perspective

2) White box testing:
-----------------------
	- done by developers
	- by knowing the internal coding knowledge
	- glass box testing, clear box testing, structural testing
	- developer perspective

3) Grey Box testing:
-------------------
	- done by testers
	- by knowing the internal coding knowledge
	- user perspective with some internal access

4) Positive testing:
--------------------
	- testing with valid input data
	- to determine what system supposed to do
	- helps to check whether the application is justifying the requirements or not
 
5) Negative testing:
---------------------- 
	- testing with invalid data
 	- to determine what system not supposed to do
	- helps to find the defects from the software

6) Formal testing:
------------------
	 - preplanned procedures and proper documentation

7) Informal testing:
--------------------
	 - not following the procedure and not documented

8) smoke testing:
-----------------
	- day zero check
	- this is done at initial stages when build is unstable
	- to make sure that the build received from the development team is testable or not
	- basic functionalitites 
	- validate the stability of build
	- build level test
	- helps to not wasting time in whole application when the key features not working properly
	- done by both developers and testers

9) Sanity testing:
-------------------
	- this is done once the build becomes stable
	- it is a subset of regression testing
	- done during the release phase to check for the main functionalities of the application without going deeper
	- validate the main functionalities
	- time constraint
	- done by testers
 
10) Regression testing:
----------------------- 
	- adding new feature or deleting / modifying  existing feature in a build may impact the other integrated builds also
	- testing new feature alone not sufficient
	- solution? - validate the entire application
	- validate the end to end scenarios(cover all functionalities)
	- whenever a new functionalities added regression testing should be done

   --> Unit Regression Testing 
   -----------------------------
	- Testing only the modules where changes or modifications done by the developers.
 
   --> Regional Regression Testing
   ----------------------------------
	- Testing modified modules along with impacted modules which can be identified by coducting Impact Analysis meeting with Developers and QA.

  --> Full Regression Testing
  ----------------------------
	- when changes has made on many modules we should do Full Regression Testing

10) Exploratory Testing:
=========================
	- if we don't have any documents related to the build received we have to explore the build and understand the scenarios and produce documentation then proceed with testing.
	- will be done by testers with previous experience in that domain but does not know about the functionalities in that application.
   Cons:
   -----
	- there will be possiblities of misunderstanding between bug and feature
	- difficult to identify bugs
	- time consuming

11)Ad-hoc Testing:
===================
	- an informal testing type quite opposite to the formal testing 
	- randomly test the application without following any documents and test design techniques
	- primarily performed if the knowledge of testers in the application under test is very high
	- randomly test the application without any test cases or any business requirement document
	- will be done by testers with previous experience in that domain and also knows about the functionalities in that application.

12) Monkey testing :
--------------------
	- performing abnormal activites	to validate the stability of the application
	- this test is done by testers without having any knowlede of application

   *Random Testing ==> Exploratory Testing , Ad-hoc Testing , Monkey testing

13) End-To-End Testing :
-------------------------
	- testing an application with test case that covers all the major functionalities of that application

14) Globalization and Localization Testing :
---------------------------------------------
  > Globalization Testing:
  -------------------------
	- Performed to ensure the system or software application can run in any cultural or local environment.
	- Different aspects of the software application are tested to ensure that it supports every language and different attributes.
	- It tests the different currency formats, mobile number formats and address formats are supported by the application.
	--> Example:  Facebook.com , Google.com

  > Localization Testing:
  ------------------------
	- Performed to check system or software application for a specific geographical and cultural environment.
	- Localized product only supports the specific kind of language and is usable only in specific region.
	- It testes the specific currency format, mobile number format and address format is working properly or not.
	--> Example: Baidu.com 

15)Beta Testing:
-----------------
	- done by a limited number of end users before delivery
	- done in the client place.

16) Live environment testing:
-----------------------------
	- after release -Bug leakage 

17) Retest:
-----------
	- to ensure the bug fixed or not
