Static Testing :
-----------------
	- Testing documents
--> Review
--> Walkthrough
--> Inspection

Dynamic Testing :
------------------
	- Testing Software
--> Unit Testing
--> Integration Testing
--> Sysyem Testing
--> UAT


Static Testing:
===============
==> Review:
===========
   --> to ensure the reliablity of documents
	--> Requirement Reviews
	--> Design Reviews
	--> Code Reviews
	--> Test Plan Reviews
	--> Test Case Reviews

==> Walkthrough:
================
	--> in case of any doubts in documents we will approach the author of the documment and he'll provide quick explaination about it.
	--> it is not pre-planned(informal testing) will be done when needed
	

==> Inspection:
===============
	--> properly scheduled review(formal)
  -- Reader --> author --> will read meating
  -- Writer --> will write or note on meeting
  -- Moderator --> will manage meeting

QA --> Quality Assurance
QC --> Quality Control 
QE --> Quality Engineering

	--> QA is process related(SDLC) will focus on building a quality product in order to prevent defects

	--> QC is actual testing of the software(STLC) will focus on testing the quality of product in order to detect the defects in builds(Both Automation and Manual Testers)

	--> QE is Automation Tester who writes code and runs test




Requirement Analysis --> BRD --> DDS --> Development plan
			     --> Test Plan --> Test Cases --> Defect log
