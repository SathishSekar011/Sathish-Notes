Paragraphs:
============
	--> a paragraph is dfined by element <p>
	--> A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
	--> browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed
	--> if we wants to display as the same format as we declared we have to use <pre> instead of <p>
	--> a paragraph will be displayed according to the size of a window(the alignment will be automatically adjusted by the browser)
	--> if we want to have a new line we must go for a new <p> element or <br> tag
	 

Formating Texts:
--------------------
==> <b>		--> bold
==> <i>		--> itallic
==> <strong> 	--> used to define text with strong importance(text inside this tag is bold)
==> <em> 	--> emphasizes on the important word or section of words
	(**==> <b> and <i> are used for style purpose whereas <strong> and <em> are used for defining the importance)
==>  <cite> 	--> defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a 			movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).				
		--> The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.
==> <dfn>	--> defines the word for which the definition is given
==> <sup>	--> Super script(power)
==> <sub>	--> Sub script(chemical formulas)
==> <br>	--> to break the current line and continue in next line

			(Eg:- famous quotes by phillosophers)
