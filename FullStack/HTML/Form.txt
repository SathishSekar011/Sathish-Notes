Form :
======
--> <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.

<input>:
---------
--> <input type="text">		--> a single-line text input field
--> <input type="radio">	--> a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
--> <input type="checkbox">	--> a checkbox (for selecting zero or more of many choices) 
--> <input type="submit">	--> a submit button (for submitting the form)
--> <input type="button">	--> a clickable button

(**==> each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted.
   ==> If the name attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all.    ==> name in radio button must have the same value)

<label>:
--------
	- defines a label for many form elements.
	- is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focuses on the input element.
	- also helps users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.
	-The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.
