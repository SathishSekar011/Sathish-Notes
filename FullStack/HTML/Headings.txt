Headings:
=========
	--> headings are the titles or subtitles that we want to display on a webpage
	--> headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags
		==> h1 --> Most Important
		==> h6 --> Least Important
	--> Search engines uses the headings to index the structure and content of a web page 
	--> It is important to use headings to show the document structure properly and more elegantly
	--> Users will browse a page based on a heading
	--> there shouldn't be more than one h1 tag in a page

==> we can specify the size of a heading with the style attribute using the CSS font-size 

	==> style = "font-size: 50px;"
