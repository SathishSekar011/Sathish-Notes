ENCAPSULATION:
==============
	-wrapping of data and the code acting on data.
	-acheived by POJO clas.

POJO--> Plain Old Java Object:
===============================
	-It is legacy class.
	-also called as bean class.
	-Usen defined class which contains private variables which can be accessed from another class.

Implementation of POJO Class:
------------------------------

1) Create a class

2) Create private variable inside the class 
3) generate getters and setters for the POJO
	-->right click on class --> Source generate getters and setters --> OK 
	[getters and setters will be generated automatically]

 	-->you won't run encapsulation in Same Program you have to execute in another class
