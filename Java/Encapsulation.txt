ENCAPSULATION:
==============
	- used for data hiding in java
	- is the process wrapping up of data(variable) with code acting on it(method) and make them to act as a single unit
	- it can be acheived with the POJO class design pattern

POJO--> Plain Old Java Object:
===============================
	-It is legacy class.
	-also called as bean class.
	-Usen defined class which contains private variables which can be accessed from another class.

Implementation of POJO Class:
------------------------------
1) Create a class
2) Create private variable inside the class 
3) generate getters and setters for the POJO
	-->right click on class --> Source generate getters and setters --> OK 
	[getters and setters will be generated automatically]
 	-->you won't run encapsulation in Same Program you have to execute in another class
